Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game!

Let's learn the nuts and bolts:

    Basic commands

        last (prints last moves)
        restart
        stats (prints current game statistics)

    Moves:
        r, rock     (rock beats scissors, but is beaten by paper)
        p, paper    (paper beats rock, but is beaten by scissors)
        s, scissors (scissors beats paper, but is beaten by rock)
